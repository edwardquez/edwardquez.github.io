Using Champions League Data to Analyze Key Metrics for Tournament Success 


<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
<details open>
  <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Project Overview:</summary>
  <p>
    This project examines team performance in the <span style="color: #b509ac;">UEFA Champions League</span> over the past five years using a <span style="color: #b509ac;">data-driven approach</span> to identify which metrics most strongly correlate with tournament success. With football tactics constantly evolving, the study seeks to provide insight into which modern play styles and team characteristics most reliably predict progress in the competition. Success is evaluated at three levels: <span style="color: #b509ac;">qualifying</span> for the tournament, <span style="color: #b509ac;">reaching the Round of 16</span>, and <span style="color: #b509ac;">reaching the Final</span>.

<!-- OBJECTIVES -->
<details>
  <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Objectives:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>To determine which <span style="color: #b509ac;">performance metrics</span> correlate most strongly with success in the UEFA Champions League</li>
    <li>To test hypotheses regarding the importance of <span style="color: #b509ac;">offensive metrics</span> such as expected goals (xG), possession, and progression</li>
    <li>To evaluate whether <span style="color: #b509ac;">average team age</span> has a measurable effect on tournament outcomes</li>
    <li>To apply <span style="color: #b509ac;">statistical and predictive models</span> (e.g., bootstrapping and logistic regression) for deeper analysis</li>
  </ul>

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->
<details>
  <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Methodology:</summary>
  <p>
    To explore which metrics contribute most to success in the UEFA Champions League, we began by collecting and merging five years' worth of team-level data from <span style="color: #b509ac;">FBref.com</span>. This dataset included over 35 variables such as <span style="color: #b509ac;">possession percentage</span>, <span style="color: #b509ac;">expected goals (xG)</span>, <span style="color: #b509ac;">progressive actions</span>, and <span style="color: #b509ac;">average team age</span> for each participating team.
  </p>
  <p>
    We defined three levels of tournament success: qualifying for the Champions League, advancing to the Round of 16, and reaching the Final. Our analysis focused on four key metrics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Expected Goals (xG)</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Possession (%)</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Progressive Carries and Passes</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Average Team Age</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For each of these metrics, we performed the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Descriptive Analysis</span> – We calculated means, variances, and distributions.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Bootstrapping</span> – We generated 1,000 bootstrap samples to estimate confidence intervals.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Correlation Analysis</span> – We computed correlation coefficients to assess associations.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #b509ac;">Logistic Regression</span> – We modeled how each metric influenced tournament progression.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Findings:</summary>

  <!-- xG -->
  <details>
    <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Expected Goals (xG):</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong indicator of success, especially for <span style="color: #b509ac;">reaching the Round of 16</span> (correlation ≈ 0.57)</li>
      <li>Finalist teams averaged over <span style="color: #b509ac;">2 xG per game</span></li>
      <li>Logistic regression: finalists had ~<span style="color: #b509ac;">2.31 xG/game</span></li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <!-- Possession -->
  <details>
    <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Possession:</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Average tournament possession: <span style="color: #b509ac;">49.2%</span></li>
      <li>Positive correlation between possession and xG (<span style="color: #b509ac;">r ≈ 0.65</span>)</li>
      <li>Each 1% increase in possession raised odds of Round of 16 by <span style="color: #b509ac;">15%</span>, Final by <span style="color: #b509ac;">5%</span></li>
    </ul>

      <li>Confidence interval for age coefficient included zero</li>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<details>
  <summary style="font-weight: bold; color: black; cursor: pointer;">Conclusion:</summary>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #b509ac;">Expected goals</span>, <span style="color: #b509ac;">possession</span>, and <span style="color: #b509ac;">progressive actions</span> are meaningful indicators of success in the Champions League. <span style="color: #b509ac;">Age</span> appears less predictive, emphasizing the value of <span style="color: #b509ac;">tactical execution</span> over demographic factors. The combination of <span style="color: #b509ac;">bootstrapping</span> and <span style="color: #b509ac;">regression modeling</span> provided robust insights, showing that <span style="color: #b509ac;">high-quality offensive output</span> and <span style="color: #b509ac;">ball control</span> are vital for tournament success.

I'm currently building a custom tool to automatically extract player statistics from Call of Duty scoreboard screenshots using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and display them in a structured dashboard for post-game analysis.

Goals:
-   Use EasyOCR and OpenCV to detect and extract structured text data (e.g., player names, scores, K/D ratios) from scoreboard screenshots.

-   Automatically identify and extract key metadata such as map, game mode, game time, and team scores from predefined regions in the image.

-   Output structured data into CSV files, organized by series and map, for long-term storage and analysis.

-   Build a Streamlit dashboard with multi-page navigation that allows users to:

-   Upload images of multiple maps from a scrim or match series

-   Analyze team and player performance over time
